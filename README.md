# Hackathon Pen Challenge 
## Calibration
Execute the Python file `python robot_move.py` to move the robot to its home position, while the gripper is opening, put the pen in between the gripper to let the robot grap it <br/>

While the robot is holding the pen run the calibration algorittm `python pen_detection.py` and passing `-c` or `--calibrate` flag to let the program do the calibration. 

## Execute the program
To execute the program, just run the program `python pen_detection.py` by passing `-r` or `--run` flag to let the robot move to the pen and grab it after the python `opencv` captures it
